Closing labels # Tree views # lsp-dart uses lsp-treemacs for rendering some tree views features. lsp-dart-show-outline * lsp-dart-show-flutter-outline * Run/Debug tests # lsp-dart-run-test-file - Run all tests from current test buffer. lsp-dart-run-test-at-point - Run single test at point. lsp-dart-debug-test-at-point - Debug single test at point. lsp-dart-visit-last-test - Go to last ran test. lsp-dart-run-last-test - Run last ran test. lsp-dart-debug-last-test - Debug last ran test. Running a test interactively: Flutter colors # Display the flutter colors on left fringe. You can disable the feature setting lsp-dart-flutter-fringe-colors to nil . Flutter widget guides # Display widget guide lines from parent to child widgets on flutter. * You can disable the feature setting lsp-dart-flutter-widget-guides to nil . Debug # For debugging, lsp-dart uses dap-mode . You only need to run dap-dart-setup one time to setup the debugger to your Emacs and dap-debug to start the debug. Flutter # lsp-dart support Flutter debugging too via dap-debug with an option to select the device to debug. After the debug session has started, you can run: lsp-dart-flutter-hot-restart - Trigger Flutter hot restart on the debug sessions. lsp-dart-flutter-hot-reload - Trigger Flutter hot reload on the debug sessions. Custom templates # You can register a custom template for debugging with dap-register-debug-template , check the following example: ( use-package lsp-dart :ensure t :hook ( dart-mode . lsp ) :init ( dap-register-debug-template \"Flutter :: Custom debug\" ( list :flutterPlatform \"x86_64\" :program \"lib/main_debug.dart\" :args ' ( \"--flavor\" \"customer_a\" )))) flutterPlatform , :program , and :args are all optional.
